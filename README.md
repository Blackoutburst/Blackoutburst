### Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm Blackoutburst no need to know my real name, just call me Blackout.\
I'm a Java developer since 2015 and I learned by myself doing random games using Java/LWJGL.\
I do have some C knowledge, but I don't really use it as I found Java more convenient to use.

Currently working on spigot/craftbukkit plugins in the hope of working at Hypixel, wish me luck !

I speak French and English and no I'm not a girl
